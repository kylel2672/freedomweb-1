<p>What we can learn from AI, is that it could be good, it could be bad. We won't know until something either bad happens or something good happens. It really depends how the media and the public views certain events related to AI, also we could take action earlier so if something were to happen, we would already have laws to prevent such events.</p>

<p>So basically, it depends how the public view of this and we should make laws to prevent turmoil.</p>
