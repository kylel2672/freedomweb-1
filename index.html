<p>Artificial Intelligence, is the ability when a computer has the intelligence of a human so it doesn't need an human to operate it.</p> 

<p>Like the car above, you've probably seen it commuting your way to whereever you go. It is a good example of AI, the AI helps you drive and even has a autonomous safety system. It also has a smart summon, to make your car its way to you. This is also a good example of the positives of Artificial Intelliegence.</p>

<p>But there is also negative effects of Artificial Intelligence. There is military use of Artificial Intelligence and also we may be too dependent on Artificial Intelligence. "Why?" you may ask, the reasoning is because of hackers, they could easily sabotage us and threatened the lives of many or may even ruin many lives.</p>

As previously mentioned, Tesla is one of the positives of Artificial Intelligence. It could help people drive and stop when necessary. It in facts, has one of the highest safety rating associated with its AI. This though, isn't the only companies that use AI in their products.

Like this, Pepper, a robot, helps with healthcare. It also is used commercially, used in shops and stores. This could help with serveral companies since they can have the robots work 24/7 and you don't have to wait for human workers as they are readily available.

Even though, Artificial Intelligence is helpful, it comes with negatives as well. Hackers can take advantage of these technologies and easily sabotage them as well. Russia, is a country that has good cyber technology. They are also know for alot of cyber attacks of America, as seen here but that isn't the only attack. They are quite know for their cyber attacks and if they could hack these technologies, then it will be really dangerous.

That isn't the only problem that AI causes, it also can take over jobs, Artificial Intelligence can give the robot the ability to do things without humans. Meaning robots can make things with less mistakes and also don't need hourly wages. Meaning loads could be jobless and poor, another negative effect of Artificial Intelligence.

What we can learn from AI, is that it could be good, it could be bad. We won't know until something either bad happens or something good happens. It really depends how the media and the public views certain events related to AI, also we could take action earlier so if something were to happen, we would already have laws to prevent such events.

So basically, it depends how the public view of this and we should make laws to prevent turmoil.
